title: "Work From Home Together"

<p>
I graduated in Spring of 2019 with a B.S. in Computer Engineering and since then have worked from home.
I've always dreamed of being able to work in the comfort of my own home or anywhere in the world.
Apart from loving code at first sight, the idea of freedom was a strong factor in my choice to study computers.
</p>

<p>
Fast forward a year and some change, I started dreading the idea of being home alone. I would constantly take walks,
surf flat waves, call friends, and simply not do work. Keep in mind this was pre-Covid19, so I still had the ability to work in
various coffee shops and etc. My productivity did not increase. It's hard to work on a laptop after having a multi-monitor
setup at home.
</p>

<p>
I started contemplating working for larger companies where I could go into a physical work place and be around others
but I kept making excuses. I was working contract jobs for various startups getting paid fairly well, I was living a
block from the beach in a tiny but comfortable apartment, and life was generally good apart from my social boredom.
I know what you're thinking, why don't you just get a WeWork? Honestly, it's probably still a good idea but at the time
I couldn't justify the cost, and presently I can't afford it.
</p>

<p>
Welcome Covid19. Welcome Twitter saying work from home is indefinite. Welcome staying home for good.
At this point I knew I really needed to figure out a good flow and increase my productivity, so I started
listing things that worked and didn't. By far the largest contributer was having my roomate home while he
was quarantined from work. Our apartment is set up like a workplace, with an open living room filled with desks,
monitors, and work stations. We've roomed since college and have always had our apartments set up in this way to
promote productivity.
</p>

<p>
I started noticing that the more he was working from home, the more work I was doing. I felt more accountable,
not as lonely, and generally more excited to work and dicuss the problems I was solving. I then started thinking
about all of the people who would begin their work from home journeys and the similar issues they might face.
</p>

<p>
WeWork solved the social issue of working remotely. Airbnb solved the issue of authentic traveling experiences.
Now think about all the people who are turning their homes into offices, this is like WeWork at a residential level.
What if all the Airbnb's turned their homes into small office spaces for teams or individuals? What if the ideas
of WeWork and Airbnb meshed and we could Work From Home (or someone's home) Together?
</p>

<p>
With Covid this isn't exactly the best idea, but in the future when things go back to normal and we can socialize more, I
would personally love to work from home with other motiviated and like minded individuals. I can imagine hosting my apartment
as a workplace during the day until my roomate gets home. I can also imagine going to other people's home to work when I get cabin
fever from my own home.
<p/>

<p>
If there was a market for such service, people could rent out parts of their homes which are setup like offices during the day
to make extra income. Commercializing such a service one could take the WeWork approach and rent large nice houses and
create office spaces out of the rooms and keep the living rooms as hotdesks. Who wouldn't want to work in nice house versus
a office building anyways?
