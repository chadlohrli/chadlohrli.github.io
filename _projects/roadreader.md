### Background
RoadReader was my first startup idea. It was the product of winning a hackathon and a dream to run my own company.
Timing is a key factor in any startup, and unfortunately my teammates and I hit it wrong. Below is the idea and story behind RoadReader.

### ScaleSD
After winning first place in the [ScaleSD](https://www.scalesd.com/) Smart Cities hackathon, ScaleSD invited us to join their
innovation program which was meant to help us take our idea to next stage. The innovation program consisted of 6 teams (some from the hackathon), 3 gates to pass, and a final prize for the one winner.

We won, and spent our college graduation day pitching our idea instead of walking the stage.

### The Idea
RoadReader's core idea was to leverage the ubiquity of smartphones and availability of municipal vehicles to automate and objectively assess city roads.

Every city has a suite of municipal vehicles covering the majority of its roads, which makes them perfect data collectors. With just a smartphone, we have the ability to capture everything these vehicles see and feel on the road using computer vision and sensory data. This frequently measured, near real-time data provides visibility to road conditions enabling us to efficiently direct road maintenance crews to area in need.

### Conclusion   
We had made good progress after ScaledSD's innovation program. Our MVP Android app was functional, our neural networks had acceptable accuracy, we were building some infrastructure on AWS, and we had met in the mayor's office to dicuss a potential pilot.

The problem was we were three college graduates with no money, lots of bills, and no promise of investment. ScaleSD had offered us an incubation deal but the deal did not include stipends which we needed to live. Additionally, working with governments is a nightmare and we felt it would be a long time before we could test out a pilot.

I had just recieved an offer at another startup during this time, my roomate accepted his offer at Qualcomm, and our third cofounder
decided to move back home to save money. All in all an amazing experience.
